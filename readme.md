#WebGL - Template

A handy template for WebGL with VS-Code build tasks set up

##Installation
First you need to clone the repository

```git clone https://github.com/RedDaturaSoftworks/WebGL-Template.git```

After you downloaded the source code, then you need to run

```npm install```

from the root directory.

When this is done, then you have two options:

###Option one: You have Visual Studio Code
If you do have it, then just open this folder in VS-Code.
You can start the live reload with
 
```(ctrl|cmd) + shift + b``` 

build command.

###Option two: You DON'T HAVE Visual Studio Code
Well, then you need to set up the stuff from the command line.
It's easy as well, just run 

```grunt watch```

and you're all set.
